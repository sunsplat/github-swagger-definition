    Get archive link.

    This method will return a 302 to a URL to download a tarball or zipball

    archive for a repository. Please make sure your HTTP framework is

    configured to follow redirects or you will need to use the Location header

    to make a second GET request.

    Note: For private repositories, these links are temporary and expire
    quickly.

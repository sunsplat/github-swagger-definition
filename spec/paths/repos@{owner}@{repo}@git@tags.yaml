    Create a Tag Object.
    Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a
    tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do
    this call to create the tag object, and then create the refs/tags/[tag]
    reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to create
    the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.

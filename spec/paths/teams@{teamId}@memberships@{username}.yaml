    Remove team membership.

    In order to remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated
    user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the
    organization that the team is associated with. NOTE: This does not delete

    Add team membership.

    In order to add a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated
    user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the
    organization that the team is associated with.


    If the user is already a part of the team's organization (meaning they're on
    at least one other team in the organization), this endpoint will add the
    user to the team.


    If the user is completely unaffiliated with the team's organization (meaning
    they're on none of the organization's teams), this endpoint will send an
    invitation to the user via email. This newly-created membership will be in
    the 'pending' state until the user accepts the invitation, at which point
    the membership will transition to the 'active' state and the user will be
    added as a member of the team.
